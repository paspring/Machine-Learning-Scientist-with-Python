# **Machine Learning Portfolio: Applying DataCamp Concepts**

This repository showcases my machine learning skills acquired through DataCamp's "Machine Learning Scientist with Python" career track. Here, I apply the concepts covered in the course to real-world problems, demonstrating my understanding of core techniques without relying on proprietary datasets.

**Project Structure**

* **Notebooks:**  Contain well-documented examples with detailed explanations, outlining the following concepts (adjust based on your completed sections):
    * Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
    * Supervised Learning Algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)
    * Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
    * Model Evaluation and Tuning
    * Natural Language Processing 
    * Image Processing 

**Docker Notes**

Start jupyter from interpreter: 
`jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --no-browser --NotebookApp.token=''`
